## **I. An Introduction to Story**

  ### _**1. What makes a story compelling?**_
  
  **1.1 Storytelling in Games**
  - Engaging stories captivate players, making them invested in characters and their journeys.
  - Traditional storytelling involves passive participation, while interactive stories invite active engagement from the reader or player.
  
  **1.2 Interative Storytelling Examples**
  - "Choose Your Own Adventure" books allow readers to make decisions that affect the story's outcome.
  - In games like Dungeons & Dragons, players influence the narrative through their choices, guided by a Dungeon Master.

  **1.3. Real-Time Decision Making**
  - Games like "Dragon Slayer" incorporate real-time choices, enhancing player involvement in the story.
  - The combination of animated storytelling and player decisions creates a compelling gaming experience focused on narrative.
  
  ### _**2. How games benefit from stories**_
  
  **2.1 emotional_connection**
  - Games designed with a narrative create an emotional bond between players and characters, making the gameplay more engaging.
  - Players become invested in the game not just for the mechanics but also for the emotional journey of the characters.

  **2.2 character_development**
  - Understanding characters and their motivations is crucial for creating a compelling story that resonates with players.
  - A well-developed backstory enriches the character's role and enhances the overall narrative.
  
  **2.3 story_motivation**
  - Seeing a game as a story provides motivation for developers to complete their projects, as personal investment in the narrative drives creativity.
  - The more personal experiences and perspectives are integrated into the story, the stronger the connection with players.

  **2.4 backstory_importance**
  - A solid backstory is essential for characters to avoid becoming forgettable; it adds depth and context to their actions.
  - Without a meaningful backstory, games risk being perceived as shallow and easily forgotten.
  
  **2.5 game_mechanics**
  - Game mechanics should align with the narrative, ensuring that every design choice serves the story being told.
  - A cohesive narrative framework helps guide design decisions, making the game more coherent and engaging.
  
  **2.6 narrative_framework**
  - Understanding traditional storytelling structures aids in designing a game that flows well and captivates players.
  A strong narrative framework ties together various design elements, enhancing the overall player experience.

  ### _**3. How to see a game as a story first**_
  
  **3.1 Protagonists and Antagonists**
  - The protagonist is the hero of the story, driving the plot forward and facing challenges.
  - The antagonist creates conflict, complicating the protagonist's quest and adding depth to the narrative.
  
  **3.2 Emotional Context in Games**
  - Games like Angry Birds illustrate the emotional connection between characters, enhancing player engagement.
  - Understanding the emotional relationship between the protagonist and antagonist helps in defining the game's story and character motivations.
  **
  **3.3 Rising Action and Game Difficulty**
  - The concept of rising action is crucial; the story's energy should increase, with escalating conflicts leading to a climax.
  - Similar to game levels, challenges should become progressively harder, requiring players to improve their skills.
  
  **3.4 Creating Compelling Narratives**
  - The lecture encourages exploring narratives in games with minimal story, like PacMan, to enhance emotional depth.
  - By defining the history and motivations of characters, designers can create richer stories that resonate with players.

  ### _**4. Defining the Spine**_
  - The **"Spine"** of a story refers to its central theme or main idea, which encapsulates what the story is fundamentally about. It acts like a backbone, guiding the narrative and ensuring that all elements—characters, scenes, and dialogue—serve this core concept. A well-defined spine allows storytellers to communicate the essence of their story in just one or two sentences.
  >
  - For example, in the case of the game "Angry Birds," the spine can be summarized as: "A family of birds flies into action to retrieve their stolen eggs from a gang of greedy green pigs by trying to knock them all over." This concise statement captures the main conflict and goal of the game, helping players understand the essence of the experience.
  
### _**5. Three-Act Structure and Rising Action**_
  - **Act-1 (set up)**: we meet the main characters and learn about the world they live in, culminating in an event that sparks the main conflict. For example, in "Sleeping Beauty," the curse placed on Princess Aurora is the inciting incident that sets the story in motion.
  
  >
  - **Act-2 (the confrontation)**: is where the action unfolds, and the hero faces various challenges and obstacles. This part builds tension as the conflict escalates, leading to a climactic moment. In "Sleeping Beauty," this is when Maleficent transforms into a dragon to stop Prince Philip.
  
   >
  - **Act-3 (the resolution)**: resolves the conflict, often with the hero triumphing over the villain, bringing satisfaction to the audience. In our example, Prince Philip defeats Maleficent and awakens Aurora, leading to a happy ending.

## **II. Game Story Structure**
  ### _**1. Writing Your Own Story Synopsis**_
  
  **1.1 Understanding Story Synopsis**
  - A story synopsis is a concise summary of the storyline, typically in paragraph form, that outlines the main elements of the story.
  - It introduces characters, sets the tone, and follows the three-act structure to define the beginning, middle, and end of the story.
  
  **1.2 Key Points for a Good Synopsis**
  - Identify the setting: Where does the story take place?
  Define the protagonist: Who is the main character and what are their goals?
  
  **1.3 Conflict and Resolution**
  - Determine the antagonist: Who opposes the protagonist and why?
  - Describe the conflict: What challenges do the characters face, and how does the action escalate towards the final crisis and resolution?

  ### _**2. Story Synopsis Points**_
  - With a simple game, we can have a shorter and more direct story synopsis. In the case of Angry Birds, it becomes more about defining the overall world and story theme in the game. Understanding how we can put a story synopsis around Angry Birds will help you identify how to create a story description for other “simple” arcade skills-based games or begin to establish the basis for more complex games. 
  - **Questions:**
  
    - Where are we; where/when does the story take place?
    - Who are we following in the story (the protagonist) and why them?
    - Who or what force is opposed to the hero of the story, and why are they in opposition (the antagonist)?
    - What do these characters want to accomplish; what is at stake for them?
    - What is the ensuing conflict, and why does it exist?
    - How does the action rise; how do things get more tense?
    - What is the final crisis, and how does it play out?
    - How do things resolve and wrap up?
    ### _**3. Defining Characters and Character Goals**_
    3.1 Character Development 
      - Characters serve as the player's portal into the game's story, enhancing engagement through their depth and personality.
      - Even in non-story games like chess, game pieces can be viewed as characters with unique traits and motivations.
      
    3.2 Protagonists and Antagonists
      - The protagonist, or hero, drives the plot and is typically the character the player controls, such as Jim Raynor in StarCraft II.
      - Antagonists have opposing goals, creating conflict; for example, Emperor Mengsk seeks to eliminate Jim Raynor to maintain power.
      
    3.3 Character Goals
    - Characters should have both immediate goals (challenges faced during gameplay) and overarching goals (deeper desires that shape their actions).
    - Understanding these goals adds depth to characters, making their motivations clearer and enhancing the overall narrative experience.

### _**4. Using Secondary Characters**_
**1. Role of Secondary Characters**
  - Secondary characters help facilitate the main story and add depth to the narrative.
  - They can create engaging interactions that make the gameplay more interesting than simple directional cues.
  
**2. Example of Character Interaction**
  - A scenario is presented where a warrior princess seeks a magic scepter and encounters a village fool instead of a signpost.
  - The interaction with the village fool can lead to dialogue and gameplay that requires the player to engage with the environment to uncover the next part of the story.
  
**3. Enhancing Gameplay through Story**
  - By incorporating secondary characters, game designers can create more dynamic and interactive experiences.
  - These characters can provide plot points and twists that keep the story engaging and the action rising, as seen in examples like Genshin Impact.
### _**5. Writing a Character Brief**_
**1. Character Development**
- Create a character list and descriptions to clarify their roles in the game story.
- Start with primary characters, detailing their actions and significance to the plot.

**2. Character Descriptions**
- Describe characters by their identity, appearance, personality, relationships, strengths, weaknesses, and goals.
- Use the example of a warrior princess to illustrate how to convey these attributes effectively.

**3. Role of Character Briefs**
- Detailed character briefs help designers visualize characters and communicate their essence.
- Concise and descriptive character profiles enhance the overall narrative and gameplay experience.

**4. Questions for Character Brief**
  - Understanding who your characters are is important to understanding your story and your game. In this lecture, we will take a closer look at the primary characters in StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty and break down their characters as exercise. Namely, we'll be making character lists and character briefs to describe who is in the story and what they do. 
  
  **List of Questions:**
   - Who is he/she? Are they a primary or secondary character and how do they relate to the game story?
  
   - What do they look like? What are they wearing or carrying with them?
 
   - What is their personality like and how does that personality help fulfill their role in the game story?
  
   - How do they relate to other characters in the game?
  
   - What are their strengths and weaknesses, and how can that affect the game story?
  
   - What are the motivating character goals for this character?

**5. Questions Setting Descriptions**
  - Where are we? 
  - What does this place have to do with the game story? 
  - How does this place relate to the characters? 
  - Where did we come from and where does this place lead? 
  - What does this setting look like?
