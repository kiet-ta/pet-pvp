### **Rules**
**I. What are rules?**
  1. World rule:
    * Example to understand that is physic logic in game, the world has gravity,e.g.
  2. Gameplay rule:
    * This is how to win or lose, how points are scored or when the game end.

**II. Breaking the Rules**
  * Rules maybe change to help player can felling exciting and funny,e.g. Sometime **DON'T NEED** logic game look the same **REALIZE**.

**III. Learning the Rules?**
  1. **_SHOW_** the concept better than **_TELL_** the concept because showing a concept to a player allows them to **SEE CONCEPT IN ACTION**.
  2. Three main ways player can discover rule:
    
  - **Documentation**: This is when players might read instructions or manuals. However, most players prefer to jump right into the game without reading. So, it's important for games to be designed in a way that players can understand the rules just by playing. For example, if a game has a pop-up that briefly explains how to use an item, it should be short and clear so players can keep enjoying the game without getting confused.

  - **Narration**: Instead of reading, some games use audio narration to guide players. This can happen while players are still exploring the game, making it feel more immersive. Good narration adds personality and helps players learn things they wouldn't know otherwise, like in games where a character narrates the story.
  
  - **In-Game Discovery**: This is about letting players learn through experience. Instead of just telling them what to do, games can create situations where players can try things out safely. For instance, if a game involves jumping from high places, the first level could be designed with lower jumps so players can practice without the risk of failing immediately.

  **IV. Questions**
  * WHAT THE RULE OF MY GAME ?
  * IN WHAT WAYS CAN I CHANGE MY RULES TO MAKE MY GAME PLAY DIFFERENTLY?
  * ARE MY RULE BALANCE?

  ### **The Story**
  * Context and Narrative: A story adds a narrative element to a game, providing context and helping players understand where they are and what is happening in the game world.
  * Enhancing Experience: A good story can make a game more engaging and emotionally impactful, encouraging players to imagine and connect with the content.
  
  **1. The Purpose of Story**
  
  The Importance of Story in Games:
  
  * Communication: A clear story helps convey the game's concept to both developers and players, making it easier to explain and understand.
  * Inspiration: A defined story provides a starting point for game development, narrowing down choices and guiding design decisions.
  * Emotion: Storytelling evokes specific emotions in players, creating a deeper connection to the game and its characters.
  
  _1.1 Writer-Driven Storytelling_
  > This mean I can control the Story and the characters. For example, if a character is stuck in a tunnel with only one way to go, the player has no real options. This can make players feel frustrated because they lose the sense of control they usually have over their character.
  
  >> Imagine watching a movie where the main character suddenly starts making silly decisions that don't fit their personality. You might feel disconnected from the story, right? That's how players can feel when a game takes away their control. However, this method can also simplify the game and allow the writer to share important parts of the story without interruptions. It can help create dramatic moments, like when a character makes a mistake that changes everything.
  
  _1.2 Writer-Led_
  > This method allows players explore a story following their **CURIOSITY** rather than having their choices made for them. Imagine I on a treasure hunt in a mysterious forest. Instead of someone telling where to go, I hear the rustling in the bushes. My curiosity leads I to investigate, and that choice takes me on a exciting adventure!

  >> The beauty of the writer-led approach is that it keeps  players engaged and feeling like they are in control of their character's journey. However, That is pretty challenge for game designers because they need to think about all the possible choices players might make just. Just like a chef creating a complex dish, they have to balance flavors (story path) to make such everything works together beautifully
  
  _1.3 Player-Led_
  > This mean the players can generate their stories, create narratives that were not intended by the game designers, leading to unique experiences. Example for the type of game: Genshin Impact, Roblox, Minecraft.e.g.

  >  Players may set personal challenges that add to the game's fun, like completing levels under unusual conditions.


**2. Roleplaying & Character Motivation**
> How to create a game story that involves both the game designer and the player. In traditional storytelling, like in movies or books, the story is usually crafted by one person, and the audience just watches or reads. However, in games, the player actively participates and can influence the story with their choices.

  - Example: Storytelling in Minecraft

    - Context: You are a game designer developing a game similar to Minecraft, where players can build and explore the world.

    - Player Interaction: Instead of writing a linear story, you invite players to participate in the creative process. They can decide where to build their house, which caves to explore, or search for treasures.

    - Player Feedback: When you test the game with a group of players, they may choose different paths that you didn't anticipate. For example, instead of searching for treasure, they might decide to build a large city.

    - Improving the Story: Based on player feedback, you adjust the story to include their choices and actions, helping them feel more connected to the world you created.
    
**3. Explaining & Imagining**

- Impact of Imagery on Interaction
  - Specific imagery (like a kitten or a sandwich) can create different reactions from players compared to generic images (like a pellet).
  - Using specific imagery helps create a rich and detailed world while guiding players on how to interact with objects.

- Reasons for Using Simple Imagery
  - Designs can become cluttered if every object is detailed, so some need to be simple to keep players focused on more important elements.
  - Limited time and resources may lead designers to only detail the most important objects.
- Ways to Convey Information Through Objects
  - Besides imagery, story, sound, behavior, and interaction can also be used to communicate information about objects to players.
  - Design decisions can significantly impact players' emotions and experiences, so careful consideration is needed when designing important game objects.

**V. The Friend and the Enemy**
1. Character
  - Character has a unique traits and personalities.
  
    - Player Character (PC): the characteres that I, as a player, control. For example, when I play Minecraft, I become Steve, I can handle flexibility like jump, run, and mine,e.g. 
    - Non-Player Character: Characters that the computer controls. In minecraft that is the village, ender dragon,e.g.
    - **"Inteligent of AI"**  basic to do that is random, in a racing game, my car speed 3.5 m/s, so I set  NPC car random speed 2-5 m/s that  is make people think NPC is thinking.
