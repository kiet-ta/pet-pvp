## **Story Workshop**

### _**1. Story ideation Techniques**_

**1.1 Game Type and Setting**

- Determine the genre of your game (e.g., arcade vs. role-playing) to guide the story's direction.
- Establish the setting (e.g., futuristic space or a cartoon world) to inform the narrative context.

**1.2 Character and Goal Development**

- Start with the hero's goal, which serves as the "spine" of the story, and explore the reasons behind this goal.
- Use a series of "why" questions to deepen the understanding of the hero's motivations and emotional connections.

**1.3 Antagonist and World-Building**

- Define the antagonist's goals and motivations to enrich the conflict within the story.
- Describe the game world in detail, creating a vivid backdrop that enhances the narrative and gameplay experience.

### _**2. Personal Writing Advise**_

**1. Writing Process and challenges**

- The author expresses the emotional struggle of writing, describing it as both enjoyable and anxiety-inducing.
- They emphasize the importance of finding a comfortable mental space to foster creativity and productivity.

**2. Creative Writing Routine**

**2.1 Knowledge**

- A structured writing routine is recommended, dedicating a specific time each day to focus solely on writing.
- The process includes reading for inspiration, brainstorming ideas, and taking breaks to clear the mind.

```
60 Golden Minutes (this time will increase after once week - 60 Minutes just for starter to get accquainted)

- 15 minutes read everything like news, books, I never readed before, dont TOUCH internet, because Twitter, Facebook can make I spend a hours.
- 15 minutes fro writing out those single line ideas.
- Take a 1-2 minute break to do nothing, it will help clean my mind, I can drink tea, look out the window, chilling,e.g.
- Rest time, to review my idea sheet, what idea top up, what I like.
```

**3. Building Ideas and Discipline**

- Writers should review their ideas and connect them to create a richer narrative.
- Consistency in this writing practice is crucial for overcoming fears and developing compelling game concepts.

### **3. About Idea Sheet**

- The concept is to allow yourself free-form creativity and just throw these ideas, however useful they may end up being, down on paper. As you may recall, the Idea Sheets I recommend are for the following:

1. Game Goals Idea Sheet - The hero’s quest in the game
2. Protagonist Idea Sheet - How the hero feels about his goals, developing wider character goals
3. Antagonist Idea Sheet - Goals and motivations for the antagonist
4. Settings and Levels Idea Sheet - Settings and environments where the story takes place.

### **4. Refining the Spine**

- Creating Idea Sheets
  - Four idea sheets are used to outline key elements: the hero's quest, the hero's feelings about their goals, the antagonist's motivations, and the settings for the story.
  - The example game concept, "The Shooter," revolves around a character named Jake, who aims to reclaim his status as a top shooter after personal tragedy.

- Developing the Hero's Journey
  - Jake's motivation stems from a past accident that killed his family, leading him to prove himself in the competitive shooting league.
  - The narrative explores Jake's emotional journey and the stakes involved in his quest to win the competition.

- Introducing the Antagonist and settings
  - The antagonist, Dead-Eye Jane, is introduced as a significant challenge for Jake, representing his internal and external conflicts.
  - The settings for the game, including the League of Shooters and various competition arenas, are also developed to enhance the story's context and depth.

  ### **5. Connecting Ideas and Characters**
  - 8 PARTS OF A STORY SYNOPSIS
    1. WHERE ARE WE?
    2. WHO ARE WE FOLLOWING?
    3. WHO OR WHAT FORCE IS OPPOSED TO THAT PROTAGONIST?

    5. WHAT's THE ENSUING CONFLICT AND WHY DOES IT EXIST?
